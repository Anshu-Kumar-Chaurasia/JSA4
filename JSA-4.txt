```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

// Logical AND (&&) example
console.log(x < 10 && y > 5); // Output: true

// Logical OR (||) example
console.log(x === 5 || y === 5); // Output: true

// Logical NOT (!) example
console.log(!(x === y)); // Output: true
```

### Difference between "==" and "===" operators:
- `==` is the equality operator and checks for value equality after coercion.
- `===` is the strict equality operator and checks for both value and type equality without coercion. For example:
```javascript
console.log(5 == '5'); // Output: true (coerced equality check)
console.log(5 === '5'); // Output: false (strict equality check)
```

### Number of Operators in JS:
JavaScript has various types of operators. There are around **30 different operators** in JavaScript, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, etc.

### Use of `parseInt` in JavaScript:
`parseInt` is used to parse a string and convert it into an integer. For instance:
```javascript
let numberString = "10";
let number = parseInt(numberString); // Output: 10
```

### Finding odd and even numbers from user input:
```javascript
let userInput = prompt("Enter a number: ");
let number = parseInt(userInput);

if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(number + " is an even number.");
} else {
    console.log(number + " is an odd number.");
}
```

This JavaScript code will prompt the user for input, convert it to an integer using `parseInt`, and then determine if the number is odd or even using the modulus operator (%).
